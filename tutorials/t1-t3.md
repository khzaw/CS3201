# Tutorial 1, 2, 3

1. CSG and ASG
  a. CSG (Concrete Syntax Grammar) is needed to show the correct syntax (how lexical tokens are grouped together)
  b. ASG (Abstract Syntax Grammar) is needed to show the semantically significant structure, defines the data structure.
2. Yes, a "while" statement can be nested in an "if" statement.
3. Yes, a "while" statement can be nested in an "if", which, in turn is nested in "while".
4.  1. is wrong 
    `"if" var_name "then" "{" stmtLst "}" "else" "{" stmtLst "}"`
    2. is correct
    3. is wrong. There must be at least one statement in the else clause.
5. All correct except 3 since Recursive calls are not allowed.
6. Yes, P modifies variables x and y. Uses z and k.


8. Parent(2,3)(2,4)(4,5)(4,6) Parent*(2,5)(2,6) `Transitive closure`

9. a,f

10. a)2,4

    b)nil

    c) Parent*(s,w) and Parent*(s,if)  and s has to be while statement


11. PQL queries
a)
  
```
variable a; 
Select Boolean such that modifies ("first", "v") ;
```
c)

```
 procedure p;
 Select p such that modifies (p, "x"):
```
d) 

```
proecedure p, q;
Select p such taht Modifies(p, "x") and Uses(p, "y") and Calls(q, p);
/* Not given anything means direct calls */
```

e)

```
while w,
stmt s1, s2;

select w such that parent(w1, s1) and parent(s1,s2);
```

f)
```
while c, call c;
Select w such that modifies (w, "y") and Parent*(w,c) and Modifies(c, "x") and Uses(c, "x").

Results : None
```

13.  a) None 
     b) 1
     c) none
     d) none
     e) 1
     f) none
     g) none
     
15.  a) 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
     b) 6, 8, 10
     c) 4, 1
     d) 4
     e) true  /* (4, 6, 7) */
     
16.  a) while w; assign a; Select a such that Next\*(10, a) and Parent\*(w, a) and Modify(a, "x");
     b) while w; assign a; Select w such that pattern a ("y", "x+z") and Parent\*(w, a).
     c) procedure p1, p2; Select p1 such that Call\*(p1, p2) and Modifies(p2, "x") and Uses(p2, "x");
     d) assign a; Select a which Affect(a, a);
