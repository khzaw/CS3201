# Tutorial 1

1. CSG and ASG
  a. CSG (Concrete Syntax Grammar) is needed to show the correct syntax (how lexical tokens are grouped together)
  b. ASG (Abstract Syntax Grammar) is needed to show the semantically significant structure, defines the data structure.
2. Yes, a "while" statement can be nested in an "if" statement.
3. Yes, a "while" statement can be nested in an "if", which, in turn is nested in "while".
4.  1. is wrong 
    `"if" var_name "then" "{" stmtLst "}" "else" "{" stmtLst "}"`
    2. is correct
    3. is wrong. There must be at least one statement in the else clause.
5. All correct except 3 since Recursive calls are not allowed.
6. Yes, P modifies variables x and y. Uses z and k.
